# CodeClause-Fake_News_Detection
CODECLAUSE DATASCIENCE INTERNSHIP

<b>Problem Statement</b>
A King of yelloe journalism, fake news is false information and hoaxes spread through social media and other online media to achieve a political agenda. In this data science project idea, we will use Python to build a model that can accurately detect whether a piece of news is real or fake. We'll build a TfidVectorizer and use a PassiveAgressiveClassifier to classify news into "Real" and "Fake".
